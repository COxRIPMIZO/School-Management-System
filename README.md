The School management Sytem is Web Based Application Develop By KHONSHU(Vishal) in year 2022.

The Application basically develop for school and colleges.
The Project is focusing on education domain where we do lots of paper work which is very overwhelmig so to  avoid them i develop this system .
and the second reason is covid-19.due to this school and collges are closed. so in this situation this type  of applications are very usefull.

How to use them ------
Step 1 - clone the repositaryfrom bbelow link...
https://github.com/COxRIPMIZO/School-Management-System.git

step 2 - extract the Zip file
Step 3 - open NetBeans Software And import that extracted folder 
Step 4 - Is some cases u will see some errors in code but u can remove that by importing neccessary dependencies
depencecies  are- 
mysql connector jar file
tom cat sever library
java servelet library
etc...

Now talk about backend of server

so for backend services we want 2  things  Mysql Databse and Tomcat  server
Mysql server - username - root is neccessary password - root neccessary
I uploaded the database file also so u can just download and import them in mysql database thats it 

Tomcat server -   so this is used for running of our web application u can also used glassfish server if u want.
